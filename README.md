CGEM could stand for "Custom Great Expense Manager" or, in spanish, "Cu√°nto
Gastamos Este Mes?". CGEM is a simple accounting and reporting web service
built in Django.

It supports handling multiple accounting books, for example to track the family
accounting, the company accounting, etc.

You can define a very naive ACL by defining which users can access which
book.

Usage
------

CGEM is a pure Python3 + Django service, so all you need is a Python3
virtualenv with all the dependencies from requirement.txt installed, and just
run the server either with the Django test server, or with the provided wsgi
file.
